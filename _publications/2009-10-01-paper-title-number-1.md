This paper aims to estimate physical parameters (e.g., dielectric constants) and physical quantities (e.g., electric and magnetic fields) in heterogeneous media. To address the limitations of existing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in handling media composed of multiple homogeneous media, we propose a domain-adaptive PINN framework tailored for such complex scenarios.
