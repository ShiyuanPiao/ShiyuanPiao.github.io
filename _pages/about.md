I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Control Systems Group at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), under the guidance of Assistant Professor Amritam Das and Full Professor Roland Toth.
My interests center around scientific machine learning, physics, and control theory, with a focus on integrating these fields to advance the modeling and control of complex dynamical systems.

My research focuses on physics-guided learning for electromagnetics.
